Improvements Made
	1.	Error Handling:
	•	Added a check to ensure enough candles are provided for the analysis.
	2.	Logic Simplification:
	•	Avoided redundant variable usage and streamlined the logic to focus only on relevant candles.
	3.	Function Documentation:
	•	Added a docstring explaining the function’s purpose, parameters, and return values to show professional practices.
	4.	Algorithm Explanation:
	•	Highlighted how the ratio and condition logic align with the problem description.

Explanation of the Strategy

This strategy detects significant price drops within a defined period and decides whether to buy:
	1.	Price Ratio:
	•	Measures the price drop relative to market volatility (standard deviation).
	2.	Mathematical Formula:
	•	Uses A - B * log(period + 1) to define a dynamic threshold for triggering buy signals.
	•	The logarithmic adjustment accounts for longer periods reducing the likelihood of significant drops.
	3.	Bearish Confirmation:
	•	Ensures the most recent candle is bearish (close price < open price) to avoid false positives.
	4.	Response:
	•	If conditions are met, it calculates the buy amount based on the ratio and a base order value from the configuration.

Key Insights to Include in the Report
	1.	Practical Application:
	•	This strategy mimics real-world trading methods like mean reversion.
	2.	Customizability:
	•	Parameters A, B, and baseOrderValue allow the strategy to adapt to different market conditions.
	3.	Risk Management:
	•	Ties buy amount to market volatility, reducing risk in highly volatile situations.
